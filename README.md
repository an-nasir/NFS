# NFS
Educational level NFS written in C++.

This is a C++ based simple NFS game in which object moves.
It uses graphics.h, As it's C++ you can run it on any machine but it's particularly written in windows. To run it in Linux based distros you need some tweaks like changing ".h" files in .hpp, removing conio.h as it is not needed in Linux etc.

#How To Run (On Windows)

Place all files in Bin directory of you Turbo C compiler.
Open REC_MOVE.cpp and run (Ctrl + F9) -- Program will asks for few things like your name, engine power etc.

Again -- This is only a basic (Educational/Learning purpose CPP project)
